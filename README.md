- Add income entries  
- Add expense entries  
- View list of transactions  
- Filter by date, category  
- Show summary (total income, total expense, net balance)  
- Edit / delete past transactions  
- Visual charts (e.g. pie chart, bar chart)  
- User authentication (optional / future)  
- Responsive UI for different screen sizes  



## Tech Stack

Here are the technologies being used (or planned):

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | (e.g. React, Angular, Vue, plain JavaScript) |
| Backend | (e.g. Node.js / Express / Flask / Django / etc.) |
| Database | (e.g. MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.) |
| Tools / Libraries | (e.g. charting library, date handling, state management, CSS framework) |

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- Node.js (v14+ or latest LTS)  
- npm or yarn  
- (If applicable) a database server (e.g. MongoDB)  
- Git  

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Siddhantjadhav69/Expense-tracker.git
   cd Expense-tracker
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Setup environment variables
   Create a `.env` file (if your project uses one) with values like:

   ```
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/expense-tracker
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

   Adjust keys as per your code.

### Running the App

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port you configured).

If there is a frontend and a backend part, you may need to start both separately (e.g. `client/` and `server/` folders).

## Usage

Once the application is running:

1. Register or log in (if authentication is implemented).
2. Add income or expense entries by selecting category, amount, date, description.
3. View transaction history.
4. Filter or search transactions by date/category.
5. See summary / analytics (charts, totals).
6. Edit or delete entries as needed.

Include screenshots or GIFs here to demonstrate UI if available.

## Roadmap / TODOs

Some things to add or improve:

* User authentication & authorization
* Recurring transactions
* Export / import data (CSV, JSON)
* Better charts & visualizations
* Mobile responsiveness & UI polish
* Notification / reminders
* Multi-currency support
* Dark mode / theme support
* Unit tests & integration tests
* Deployment scripts
